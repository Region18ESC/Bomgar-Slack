# Bomgar-Slack
Simple page to relay messages from Bomgar to a Slack Channel

The main purpose of this is to post a message in Slack for new support sessions. 
We capture and post the Customer name when they start a session and Representative name when the session is accepted.

It is very crude code but we wanted to share, we tried to comment everything that needs to be changed for it to work for you.

Here is a link to a Google Doc with screenshots for our Bomgar configuration and how it appers in Slack. https://docs.google.com/document/d/1yzqsHyMLNJNABCE1fGzpShhVYw4nWCM2wyFG8wwX1I0/edit?usp=sharing
