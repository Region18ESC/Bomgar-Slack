# Bomgar-Slack
Simple page to relay messages from Bomgar to a Slack Channel

A very simple page we created to relay outbound events from Bomgar to a slack channel. It is very crude code but wanted to share, we tried to comment everything that needs to be changed for it to work for you.

Here is a link to how we have Bomgar configured. https://docs.google.com/document/d/1yzqsHyMLNJNABCE1fGzpShhVYw4nWCM2wyFG8wwX1I0/edit?usp=sharing
